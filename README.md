# Up-n-down

"Sobe e Desce" is a portuguese card game up to 4 players with a 40 card deck (cards 8 through 10 are discarded).
The main goal is to win hands in each round and the players start with a pre-determined score.
Each won hand will lower the player's score and a player wins when he reaches 0.
The 7 is the second highest card and the J is higher than the Q.
